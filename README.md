# Nagidash

Very simple monitoring dashboard for Nagios where you see only items which return state other then 0.

Nagidash is based on "Nagios Dashboard - PHP" which is presented here (https://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Addons/Frontends-%28GUIs-and-CLIs%29/Web-Interfaces/Nagios-Dashboard--2D-PHP/details#_ga=2.211361109.1353996912.1550563425-409400710.1548750848). It uses 
Bootstrap 4 and currently work with Nagios version Nagios® Core™ 4.4.3. I have not tested it on any others versions.

Please feel free to use and edit Nagidash to fit your needs.

If you have any wishes let me know.



TODO:

<s>1. Include also items which are in unknown state - DONE</s>

<s>2. In httpd errorlog is plenty of these errors:

    Undefined offset: 0 in /var/www/html/nagidash/index.php on line 124
    
    and

    Undefined offset: 0 in /var/www/html/nagidash/index.php on line 124

    This need to be fixed so i does not flood the errorlog
</s>
    
3. Webbrowser push notifications?
